# What is this?
This is an OS, which is supposed to run on actual hardware. Even though i have not checked it on real hardware it does work in a VM and i have added things that will help run this in real hardware from my past experiences (hopefully).

This will stay eniterly in **real mode** cuz i have a bad history with interrupts from protected mode

# How to execute it?
I have only added windows support for the time being. Have a look at the comp.bat, you will come to know what it does and then make your own script file.

Just run comp.bat and it should compile it first then launch the VM, if there is something wrong it will display an error.
